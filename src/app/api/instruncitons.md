The provided code looks correct for resolving the `id` property issue and includes proper comments and documentation. However, here are a few additional notes to ensure everything works smoothly:

1. **Custom Type for `Session`:** The `Session` type extension correctly allows the `id` property on the `user` object, resolving the TypeScript error.

2. **TypeScript Safety for `session.user`:** The `session` callback properly adds the `id` property by merging the existing session user object with the `id` from the token.

3. **Error Handling in `authorize`:** The `authorize` method properly validates input, checks for the existence of the user, and verifies the password securely.

4. **Usage of Environment Variables:** Ensure the required environment variables (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) are set in your `.env` file.

No further corrections are required. You can proceed to integrate this with your Next.js app.
