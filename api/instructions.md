To set up and activate a virtual environment (`venv`) in Windows using VS Code with Bash, follow these steps:

1. **Open VS Code** and launch the integrated terminal (`Ctrl + `) in **Bash** mode.

2. **Navigate** to your project directory where you want to create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Create the virtual environment** by running the following command:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   In Windows using Bash (from Git Bash, WSL, or similar), the command is:
   ```bash
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

After running the above, your terminal should show the name of the virtual environment (`venv`) at the beginning of the prompt, indicating that it's active. You can now install and manage dependencies within the virtual environment using `pip`.

5. **Install requirements**:
   Run and install all requirements as follows
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run Fast API
    Run Fast API
    ````
    python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

    ````

---
### **Accessing Your Running FastAPI Server**
Now that FastAPI is started, you can access it via the browser or API testing tools.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open FastAPI in the Browser**
- If you started FastAPI with:
  ```sh
  python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
  ```
- Open your browser and go to:

  - **Interactive API Docs (Swagger UI)**:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/docs
    ```
  - **Alternative Redoc Documentation**:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/redoc
    ```
  - **Direct API Endpoint Example (If You Have `/chat`)**:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/chat
    ```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ If Running on a Remote Server**
If you're running FastAPI on a **remote machine**, replace `localhost` with the server's IP:

```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000/docs
```

Example:
```
http://192.168.1.100:8000/docs
```

To allow external access, make sure you started FastAPI with:

```sh
python -m uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

If accessing externally, check **firewall settings** to ensure port `8000` is open.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing with `curl` or API Tools (Postman, HTTPie)**
You can also test API endpoints via command line:

```sh
curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8000/docs' 
```

Or using **Postman**:
- Open Postman
- Enter `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Send a **GET** request.

---

### **Final Checks**
If FastAPI isn‚Äôt accessible:
1. **Ensure Uvicorn is running** (`python -m uvicorn ...`).
2. **Check for Firewall Issues** if running on a remote server.
3. **Try a Different Port** (`--port 8080` or another unused port).

# Here‚Äôs a checklist to ensure everything is set up properly:

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   First, make sure you activate the virtual environment correctly. The prompt should show `(.venv)` at the beginning, indicating that it's active. To activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   ```

2. **Verify `uvicorn` Installation:**
   Once the environment is activated, verify that `uvicorn` is installed:
   ```bash
   pip show uvicorn
   ```
   If it‚Äôs not installed, run:
   ```bash
   pip install uvicorn
   ```

3. **Check Path to `uvicorn` Executable:**
   After activating the virtual environment, check if `uvicorn` is available:
   ```bash
   which uvicorn
   ```
   On Windows, you can use the `where` command instead:
   ```bash
   where uvicorn
   ```

4. **Use Python to Start Uvicorn:**
   If `uvicorn` is still not recognized, try running it through Python directly to ensure you're using the environment‚Äôs installation:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

5. **Ensure You're Using the Correct Terminal:**
   If you're using Git Bash or another terminal, ensure you're in the right terminal session where the virtual environment is active. If you're using Visual Studio Code‚Äôs integrated terminal, make sure it's set to use Bash or the terminal you're working with. You can also check the terminal's working directory and confirm that it‚Äôs inside your project folder and that the virtual environment is active.

6. **Check Virtual Environment‚Äôs Path:**
   Sometimes, when you have multiple Python installations, it can lead to the wrong version of Python being used in the virtual environment. Make sure that when you run `which python` or `where python` within the `.venv` environment, it points to the correct path, i.e., inside the `.venv` directory.

7. **If Problems Persist:**
   If the above steps still don't resolve the issue, try deactivating the environment:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
   And then reactivate it:
   ```bash
   source .venv/Scripts/activate
   ```
